# Logger Tests

This is a small repository to evaluate a couple of common logging stacks. 

Currently it contains:
- Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Grafana)
- Grafana Stack (Loki, Promtail, Grafana)
- Rust-y Stack (Quickwit, Vector)

You should be able to open any of the subfolders of this repository and run 

```
docker compose up
```
